## Machine learning project for Math 495

My final project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to take images of handwritten numbers or basic math symbols (+, -, ×, ÷) and convert them into text. 

Dataset used: https://cainvas-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/user_data/Yuvnish17/data.zip
- consists of both png and jpg images of handwritten numbers (0-9) and math symbols (+, -, ×, ÷) 
- >400 images per category

Technology used:
- All code in python
- TensorFlow and keras for main CNN model
- Google Colab Pro, A100 GPU with High-RAM, to run and test model
